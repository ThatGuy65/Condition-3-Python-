You look up and see them cowering before you; they know what happens when you mix DMQ and Ajax, and they fear for their lives. Of course, you would never actually mix them, because it would endanger the students and faculty as well, but the threat is enough for the pipecats to flee when you approach them.\\n\\nWith the cats gone, you unlock the cages to free your fellow Smathers, and you hurry back to the tunnel. As the last of the students are climbing up into the clinic, you hear growling from behind you. In a last ditch effort to repel them, you throw the bucket as far as you can into the tunnel, holding your breath as if you had added the DMQ. The pipecats flee once again, and you manage to escape.\\n\\nYou are victorious, having saved the students and teachers and avoided demise by the hands of the pipecats. As a reward for your valiant deeds, you are crowned the king of NCSSM, giving you an unlimited budget for SAB and garnering the undying loyalty of the students. Congratulations, Taylor Parsons.\\n\\nDISCLAIMER: Never actually combine Ajax and DMQ\")\n",
